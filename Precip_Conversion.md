## Precipitation Units Conversion

### One cubic millimeter of water is 0.000001 kg of water
1 mm^3 = 1 * 10^-6kg

### Or, one kg of water is 1 million cubic millimeters of water
1kg = 1,000,000 mm^3
Note, this is also a litre of water

### One liter per square meter equals how many mm per square mm?
There are 1,000,000 square mm in a squre meter. So one litre, or 1,000,000 cubic mm of water would fit as one level of one mm high cubes of water on one square meter

### One kg m-2 s-1 equals one mm of rain per second, so how much rain per month?
Over a month, that would be 30 days * 3600 seconds * 24 hours * (mm of rain per second) to get mm of rain per month
